## Project Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify potentially fraudulent transactions to protect cardholders from unauthorized charges.

## Dataset Information

### Source
- Dataset: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- Platform: Kaggle
- Provided by: Machine Learning Group - ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles)

### Dataset Characteristics
- **Time Period:** September 2013
- **Total Transactions:** 284,807
- **Fraudulent Transactions:** 492
- **Imbalance Ratio:** 0.172% (fraudulent transactions)

### Features
- **Input Variables:** 
  - V1-V28: Principal Components (PCA Transformed)
  - Time: Seconds elapsed between transactions
  - Amount: Transaction amount

- **Target Variable:**
  - Class (0: Non-Fraudulent, 1: Fraudulent)

## Key Challenges

### Class Imbalance
The dataset is highly unbalanced, with fraudulent transactions representing only a small fraction of the total transactions. This presents significant challenges for machine learning model training.

### Confidentiality
Due to confidentiality constraints, the original features have been transformed using PCA, limiting direct interpretability of the input variables.

## Recommended Evaluation Metrics

### Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)
- Traditional accuracy metrics are not meaningful for this dataset
- AUPRC provides a more appropriate evaluation method for imbalanced classifications

## Project Objectives
1. Develop a machine learning model to detect credit card fraud
2. Handle extreme class imbalance
3. Minimize false negatives (undetected fraudulent transactions)
4. Provide a reliable fraud detection mechanism

## Suggested Approach
- Implement advanced resampling techniques
  - Oversampling (SMOTE)
  - Undersampling
- Explore ensemble methods
- Consider cost-sensitive learning
- Utilize anomaly detection algorithms

## Potential Algorithms
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Machines
- Neural Networks
- Isolation Forest
- One-Class SVM

## Ethical Considerations
- Protect customer financial information
- Minimize false positives to prevent customer inconvenience
- Ensure model fairness and non-discrimination
